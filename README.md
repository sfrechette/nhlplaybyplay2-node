**Hope your familiar with thisâ€¦**

2017-2018 NHL Season Schedule -> 
http://live.nhl.com/GameData/SeasonSchedule-20172018.json  
This URL (API) outputs the complete NHL regular season schedule in JSON format

Play by Play for game 2017020001 ->
<strike>http://live.nhl.com/GameData/20172018/2017020001/PlayByPlay.json</strike>  
The following URL (API) used to provide the detailed play-by-play for a specific game... It doesn't work anymore! 

Now will be using this one ->
http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2017020001/feed/live  
A richer output with more detailed events and information.  


## Installation
Install the dependencies with the following command:
```
npm install
```

Create a `data` directory:
```
mkdir data
```

*Before using you will need to create a specific directory for the season(s) you will be fetching data for.*
i.e. To fetch data from the 2017-2018 NHL season you need to create the following folder `20172018` under the `data` directory.
